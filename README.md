# BeaconProject
This is a Project which would be used by the Clinics to register patients and View Information. Once a Patient is registered, an Email is
sent to the receptionist using Spring Mail. I have used POST method to register a patient and GET method to view the patients.
This is more of a backend project. Technologies - Spring MVC, Spring Rest, Hibernate as ORM with Oracle database, html, AngularJS, Postman
to test the backend.
